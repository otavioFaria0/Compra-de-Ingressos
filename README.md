# Ticket Purchase System

## Overview

This project is a ticket purchasing system developed to practice programming logic and backend-oriented reasoning using JavaScript. The application simulates a real-world ticket sales flow, including stock control, validation rules, and state updates, while using HTML and CSS strictly as supporting tools for visualization.

The focus of the project is not advanced frontend techniques, but rather the correct implementation of business rules and control flow.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- Practice programming logic and decision-making structures  
- Simulate backend-like behavior on the client side  
- Implement stock control and validation rules  
- Avoid excessive reliance on JavaScript-specific shortcuts  
- Build a reusable base project for ticket purchasing systems  
- Prepare the logic for future backend implementations

## Features

- Purchase tickets by category (Pista, Upper Seats, Lower Seats)
- Independent stock control per ticket type
- Quantity validation before completing a purchase
- Dynamic update of available tickets
- Temporary success feedback after a valid purchase
- Clear error handling for invalid requests

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Application Flow

1. The user selects a ticket type  
2. Defines the desired quantity  
3. The system validates availability  
4. If the purchase is approved:
   - Stock is updated
   - A success message is displayed briefly  
5. If the purchase is denied:
   - An error message explains the reason  

All logic is handled through explicit conditional flows, simulating backend validation rules.
